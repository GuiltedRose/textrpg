# textrpg
A little project I am working on for myself.

## Installing the game
In order to build the project, you need to make a build directory(folder). After this we can run `cmake -G "Ninja" -B build'.
Note: you will need to install ninja first, but it's not needed, you can use any build system including VisualStudio.

**Currently there's no need to run the project, since we have nothing to show for ourselves yet.**
